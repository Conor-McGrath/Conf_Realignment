# Conf_Realignment
R Shiny app allowing users to align their own conferences for NCAA Division 1 sports

The app can be accessed via this link: https://conor-mcgrath.shinyapps.io/Conference_Realignment/

The xslx and csv files contain data used in creating the dataframe of Division 1 teams.

The Conference Realignment Article files contain the results of my ideal conference alignment scenario along with explanations for the motivations behind various moves. 
This article is available in PDF and Word format. A post I have written arguing for the need for conference realignment in college football is published on [theSporting.blog](https://thesporting.blog/blog/ncaa-college-sports-the-post-covid-way-forward).

The www folder contains all the images used in the app.
